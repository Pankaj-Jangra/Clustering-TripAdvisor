# Clustering-TripAdvisor
TripAdvisor, Inc. is an American travel and restaurant website company that shows hotel and restaurant reviews, accommodation bookings and other travel-related content.
It also includes interactive travel forums. Headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts, TripAdvisor is the largest travel website in the world, with more than 315 million reviewers (active and inactive) and over 500 million reviews of hotels, restaurants, attractions and other travel-related businesses. 
TripAdvisor was an early adopter of user-generated content. The website services are free to users, who provide most of the content, and the website is supported by a hotel booking facility and an advertising business model. This data set is populated by crawling TripAdvisor.com. Reviews on destinations in 10 categories mentioned across East Asia are considered. 
Each traveler rating is mapped as Excellent (4) Very Good (3) Average (2) Poor (1) Terrible (0) And average rating is used against each category per user. All of us that use Trip Advisor gets good advice on where we can eat, sleep, go on adventure etc. So you are helping others get a good experience around the world which is a great benefit! Besides that the feeling of knowing that you've help others is always nice, which is why I often review restaurants on Trip Advisor. Now the company wants to use this data to undestand who are having similar reviews on the following categories.
